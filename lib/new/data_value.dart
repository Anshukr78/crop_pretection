      "Generally, sweet potato crop is grown for its sweet root tubers and mainly used as food after sthaming, or boiling, frying or baking. Sweet potato is cultivated as starchy food crop in the tropical and subtropical frost free climatic regions. Due its high calorie content, sweet potato is being used as livestock feed. Sweet potato is popularly known as Sakharkanda in India. Sweet potato is an important source of starch, glucose, industrial alcohol and sugar syrup. Sweet potato is native to tropical America and belongs to the family of Convolvulaceae and genus of Ipomoea",
      "Sweet potato cultivation requires a well drained sandy loam soil rich in humus with clay (loose) sub soil for best tuber production. If the soil pH is less than 5.3. liming the soil is required. In case of heavy soils, tuber size will be less. The ideal pH range of soil should be 5.7 to 6.7 for best yield of the tubers. :- About 40 thousand to 50 thousand vine cuttings can be accommodated in one hectare of land. Sweet potato vine cuttings should be planted during June to July for rainfed conditions. Under irrigated conditions, planting should be done during Oct to Nov in uplands & during Jan to Feb in low lands for summer crop cultivation. Make the ridges of 25 to 30 cm height at 60 cm apart after giving couple of ploughings in the main field. Vine cuttings with the length of 20 to 30 cm should be buried horizontally with 2 to 3 nodes below the soil by leaving the remaining portion of the cutting above the soil."

The edible roots of the plant are usually cylindrical and tapered and are white, brown or reddish in color. When it comes to planting material, it is recommended to plant disease and insect free plants of 8 to 9 months old having thickness of 2 to 3 cm.

After making the soil loose enough and friable, stakes (stem cuttings) can be planted @ 5cm depth.

Non branched types require 75 x 75 cm, semi branched and branched type requires 90 x 90 cm for best tuber yield. Planting one stake per hill is recommended.

      "Acid lime trees are small, bushy with small but sharp spines. Leaves and small with narrowly winged petioles. Flowers and fruits are small. Flowers are borne on two types of shoots, one with leaves and the other without leaves. Leafy inflorescences are borne on new wood, while leafless inflorescences are borne on old wood. Leafy inflorescences are more productive than leafless inflorescence, thus the presence of leaves is essential for production. Staminate and hermaphrodite flowers are produced on the same tree with varying intensities. Kagzi lime produces more hermaphrodite flowers than Tahiti Lime. The percentage of perfect flowers are higher because of mild season in the beginning of flowering and gradually decreases as the season advances. Fruits are round to oval. Fruits mature irregularly throughout the year, greenish yellow in colour and juice is highly acidic. Seeds are small, smooth and cotyledons whitish.",
      "Most ideal season of planting is June-August. Dig pits measuring 1m x 1m x 1m for plantation of seedlings. Use FYM @15-20 kg, super phosphate@500 g per pits before planning.Standard spacing for limes and lemons (Citrus Aurantifolia Swingle & Citrus Lemon) is 6 x 6 m and 5 x 5 m respectively. Consider density of 275 for limes and 400 for lemons per hectare. ",

      "Fenugreek is an herbaceous annual plant that belongs to the Fabaceae family. It is grown for its leaves and seeds which are used as an herb or spice. The botanical name of Fenugreek is called Trigonella foenum-graecum. The Fenugreek plant can have a single stem or can be branched at the stem base. It has an erect growth habit and a strong, and sweet aroma. The plant leaves are small and trifoliate with oval leaflets which are green to purple. It produces solitary pale white or purplish color flowers and a straight or curved yellow pod. Coriander Fenugreek is also called Methi. It is an annual herb mainly cultivated for seed as well as for its leaves (fresh or dried). The Fenugreek seeds are used as spices and condiments to improve the flavor and the nutritive value of foods. Fenugreek seeds are used as a seasoning agent for pickles and vegetables. Fenugreek is a very popular herb. Its leaves are used as vegetables and seeds as a spice. It has a strong aroma and unique bitter flavor.",
      "Growing Fenugreek in containers is easy. It's similar to any other green vegetable. Take a wide planter at least 6 to 8 inches deep with good drainage. It has shallow roots so it won't mind the low depth. • Fill the pot with a rich potting mix. You can mix about 1/3 part compost or well-rotted cow or horse manure to it. Sprinkle Fenugreek seeds all over the pot and dust a thin quarter-inch layer of soil briskly to cover them. Leave 1 to 2 inches of spacing between seeds. If you're growing Fenugreeks as a microgreen don't care about the spacing of seeds. • Container - Take any container of your choice, preferably a shallow tray or crate will do. Make sure the pot or container has drainage holes at the bottom.. Carefully fill the container with potting mixture i.e. good quality soil with added organic manure. Also, Fenugreek can be grown in sandy soil or even pure sand. • Sowing - Evenly sprinkle the Fenugreek seeds all over the soil. Fenugreek seeds are easily available, and you can also use the seeds from the grocery store which are meant to be used as food. • Germination - Cover the Fenugreek seeds after sowing by sprinkling more soil on them. Seeds germinate within 3 to 4 days. • Harvesting - Microgreen Methi can be harvested within 8 to 10 days of sowing. Methi greens as a regular vegetable can be harvested in 3 to 4 weeks when leaves are mature. Harvesting Fenugreek is done by uprooting the entire plant and cutting off the long roots. Though, re-sowing of Fenugreek seeds can be done in the same container after a gap of one week for the next round of harves",

      "Spacing between plants should be kept between 6×6 m. "
          "If planting is done spacing of 6 X 6 meters then 833 plants will be required for one ha. i.e. for 5 acres, you will require 1686 plants. Pits of size 60×60×60 cm should be dug for planting seedlings.Sow citrus seeds in nursery on bed of 2 m x 1 m size and with 15 cm distance between the rows. When seedlings are of 10-12 cm height, transplanting is to be done. Select healthy and uniform size seedling for transplantation purpose. Remove dwarf and weak seedlings. If needed, pruned roots slightly before planting. In nursery, Budding is done when plants are of pencil thickness. Shield budding or T shape budding is done for that, T shaped slot is made in bark of tree at distance of 15-20 cm from ground. Horizontal cut of about 1.5-2 cm long is given, and vertical cut of 2.5 cm long is made from middle of horizontal cut. Remove bud from bud stick and insert it into T shape slots, afterward wrapped it with plastic paper. T budding is done during February-March and also in August- September.",
